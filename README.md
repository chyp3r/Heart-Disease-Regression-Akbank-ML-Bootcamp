# Heart-Disease-Regression-Akbank-ML-Bootcamp
Python based Heart Disease Regression System for Akbank ML Bootcamp

## Problem
* Developing a Model That Predicts Heart Disease Targets Using Machine Learning
* The project was developed during Akbank Machine Learning Bootcamp. 

## Dataset
* This heart disease dataset is curated by combining 5 popular heart disease datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. The five datasets used for its curation are:
        * Cleveland
        * Hungarian
        * Switzerland
        * Long Beach VA
        * Statlog (Heart) Data Set.

* This dataset consists of 1190 instances with 11 features. These datasets were collected and combined at one place to help advance research on CAD-related machine learning and data mining algorithms, and hopefully to ultimately advance clinical diagnosis and early treatment.
